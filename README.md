# PCA-LDA-for-product-shipment-analyis

Objective:
Visualizing high dimensional data using PCA and doing dimensionality
reduction to check the explained variance using the PCA model. Training a
Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) model to check if the product has been
shipped or canceled.

### Problem Statement:
XYZ.com is an e-commerce company based in Argentina. Due to the covid
crisis and lockdown XYZ.com is facing lots of issues from the dealer and the
shipment team. XYZ.com has lots of product data where various shipping and
sales details of each product have been mentioned. XYZ.com wants to find out
which of the products has been shipped and which of the products has been
canceled to reduce customer escalation. As a data-scientist, we have to train a
PCA model to visualize its higher-dimensional data and we have to train an
LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) model to predict which of the products has
been shipped and which of the products has been canceled.
